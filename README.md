# Canberra Bus Time Table

I implemented this IOS app few years ago and it is my first GTFS mobile application, the app is used to display all buses routes and timetables.

There is a new version avaliable in Apple Store, it is using Brisbane's GTFS data.

## Getting Started

1. To run this app, you have to get GTFS data from Canberra government website.
2. Convert the GTFS data to mysql database.
3. Get the php file which is in the root folder of this repository.
4. Modify prefix.h to set the QUERY_URL to be your remote php url, you have to upload the php file to your cloud server or web server.


### Prerequisities
1. You understand GTFS file structure.
2. You know how to covert GTFS zip file to mysql database.
3. You need a cloud server or web server which is supporting php.
